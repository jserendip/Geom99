      I do not give
      you what you ask for, wind.
      Beat the hell out of me!  You will
      hear no satisfying
      snap of trunk, tearing of branches.
      Howl through my leaves
      like lightening's swift hopelessness;
      I will not offer you my bones
      broken or gluttonous sadness.
      Pour on me torrents of immortalities,
      days like galaxies, pangs of the heart
      so momentous they have no cause.
      I will not hear you.  I will die
      my own way, small and meaningless and full
      of love.  I bend not out of humble passivity.
      I bend because I'm bent, as the eye
      defines the hurricane.
                                - James Serendip
