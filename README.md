Create Please complete the full exercise provided by Google. With the final map, can you embed this into a website? Create a visually pleasing yet simple "shark spotters" page that references your created map.

Issues with embedding it using an iframe? Be sure you're using the "embed" link. See an example of the solution here: https://shawnmflemingc.github.io/geom99/mymapsiframe.html

## Google Maps as a Development Platform
Due Jan 25, 2021 12:00 PM

Read Understand the three pillars of Google Maps as a platform: Maps, Routes and Places. 

https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/ (using the "getting started" button does all this: https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started)

Get started and be sure to enable keys for all the three environments. Then try to create an introductory example for each of the "getting started" items

(You can find most of the samples and more directly on GitHub at this address: https://github.com/googlemaps/js-samples)
### 1. JavaScript API (HTML Interactive Map):

Create Create the Overview (hello world) example and host in GitHub: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial
### 2. Directions API (JSON Return)

Create Follow the Get Started instructions for directions and form a URL to provide route directions in JSON: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/start

Note:  Due to CORS you cannot "use" this result client-side in JavaScript or target an iFrame. This url generates only a JSON response, not a webpage -- that is all  you need -- put your URL into an HTML document and share an example "JSON" result from that URL. Make that HTML link an A tag so it can be clicked and target a new tab. 

If not creating a webpage to run your URL, at least document it using the GitHub MD file / markdown language (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Be sure you include BOTH your URL and the valid RESPONSE in your MD or HTML webpage documentation. 
### 3. Places API (JSON Return)

Create Get a places details URL working to return JSON: https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/details. Like the Directions API, you can include this on the same page. If not creating a webpage to run your URL, at least document it using the GitHub MD file / markdown language (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

Get the examples working and prove your understanding of each through tweaks or documentation. For example, try the examples in the documentation, then modify the map/urls to locations that YOU KNOW to demonstrate your understanding. Bonus Big bonus if you can find and repeat/demonstrate a bug or major issue!!!  

Keep your results and host them in GitHub for the next practical lab.
