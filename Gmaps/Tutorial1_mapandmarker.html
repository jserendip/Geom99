    <p>I do not give<br>you what you ask for, wind.<br>Beat the hell out of me!  You will<br>
      hear no satisfying<br>snap of trunk, tearing of branches.<br>Howl through my leaves<br>
      like lightening's swift hopelessness;<br>I will not offer you my bones<br>
      broken or gluttonous sadness.<br>Pour on me torrents of immortalities,<br>
      days like galaxies, pangs of the heart<br>so momentous they have no cause.<br>
      I will not hear you.  I will die<br>my own way, small and meaningless and full<br>
      of love.  I bend not out of humble passivity.<br>I bend because I'm bent, as the eye<br>
      defines the hurricane.
