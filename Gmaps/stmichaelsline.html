    <h1>The Line of Saint Michael</h1>
    <p>Thought by some to be a mystical "ley line" that extends from Ireland through to Turkey<br>
    the "Line of Saint Michael" is a line along which numerous monasteries and sacred sites<br>
    can be found, all of which are dedicated to the Archangel Michael, and many of which<br>
    also have legendary origins in which the Archangel appeared to some religious or political<br>
    figure and instructed them to build in the given location.  It is an interesting coincidence<br>
    that these all fall in such a direct line even though made over centuries by different cultures.<br>
    While making this story map I discovered that they LOOK very linear on a projected map, but the <br>
    actual coordinates fall under an arc, not in a direct line!<br>

    <h3>Skellig Michael</h3>
    
    <p>
        Though exact dates are not known, the evidence suggests there has been a monastery<br>
        dedicated to Saint Michael at Skellig Michael in Ireland since the 8th Century.<br>
        You may recognize these structures from the film "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker"

    <h3>Saint Michael's Mount</h3> 
    <p>
        Monastic buildings were built in the 12th century on this island<br>
        off the coast of Cornwall.  Notice how similar this area is<br>
        to Mont St. Michel in France!

    <h3>Mont Saint Michel</h3> 
    <p>
        Like Saint Michael's Mount in England, Mont St. Michel is built on a hill on a small island.<br>
        This monastery was supposedly built here at the direct instruction of the Archangel Michael<br>
        in the year 708AD  Included is a "streetview" from inside the chapel.

    <h3>Santuario di San Michele del Gargano</h3> 
    <p>
        Supposedly begun as a monastery around the year 490 when the Archangel Michael<br>
        appeared several times to the Bishop of Sipontum in Foggia Italy.<br>
        Although not on the seashore, it is also built on a promontory of rock.<br>
        Also included is a map showing directions from Santuario si San Michele Gargano to<br>
        Normandy where Mont St. Michel is found, highlighting that the development in this<br>
        area of Europe also somewhat follows this "line".
