Use the Create Data / New Hosted Layer to generate an empty layer (often empty layers are called a schema) in ArcGIS Online's Data Store. Create a layer to store. Use the specifications from the Fall Geom65 tree collection database description (below) to provide a "framework" to create this new schema, or if you have your own idea get approval and you can create a layer to capture that. Once created, you can try adding data into this using a webmap with full editing controls to see how it works. Record the item ID URL for this hosted feature layer, and also find the REST URL and record that too (more on that in the next item). You can store these links in a webpage or MarkDown document on your GitHub for this weeks' activities.
